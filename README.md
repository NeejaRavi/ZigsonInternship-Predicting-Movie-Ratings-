Movie Rating Prediction with Python
    This repository contains the code and resources for a project that predicts movie ratings using Python. The project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics.

Key Features:
    Data preprocessing to handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
    Model building using linear regression algorithm.
    Evaluation of the model's performance using mean squared error.

Acknowledgments:
    I would like to thank Zigson Technologies Private Limited for their support and mentorship throughout the project.
